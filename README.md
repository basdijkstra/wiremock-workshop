WireMock workshop
==================
For those of you looking to gain some experience working with [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/), here are all the materials from a workshop I've created and delivered multiple times to good reviews. Feel free to use, share and adapt these materials as you see fit.

What topics are covered?
---
This workshop covers the following topics:
* An introduction to service virtualization
* Getting started with WireMock
* Request matching strategies and fault simulation 
* Creating stateful mocks
* Response templating
* Extending WireMock

How does it work?
---
You can go through all the materials in your own time, at your own pace. The slides explain the concepts, and you can use the exercises to practice those concepts yourself.

All exercises come with REST Assured-based tests that verify the implementation of your mocks. The answers to the exercises are supplied as a reference.

I've taken care of all the setup, so there shouldn't be a need to configure anything. 

What do I need?
---
A Java JDK (version 17 or newer) and Maven. That's it.

Slides
---
The .odp, .pdf and .pptx files in the root folder contain all slides from the workshop. Again, feel free to use, share and adapt them to fit your own requirements.

Comments? Saying thanks?

Feel free to file an issue here or email me at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I'd rather have you deliver the workshop instead...

Sure, I'd love to. Again, email me and I'll be happy to discuss options. In house, online, or at your conference, I'm sure we can work something out.
